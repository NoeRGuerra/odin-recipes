    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These air fryer chicken tenderloins beat chicken nuggets any day and the recipe is so simple. I tend to use
        chicken tenderloins but you can use sliced chicken breasts if easier.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 chicken tenderloins</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Overhead of crumbled chicken tenderloin ingredients in various bowls and measuring cups. </li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Overhead of whisked eggs in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and oil together in a second bowl until mixture becomes loose and crumbly.</li>
        <li>Dip each chicken tenderloin into the bowl of egg; shake off any residual egg. Dip chicken into crumb
            mixture, making sure it is evenly and fully covered.</li>
        <li>Overhead of raw chicken breasts being dipped in an egg mixture, breaded, and placed on a baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Lay chicken tenderloins in the air fryer basket in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Air-fry until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
            center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Overhead of cooked breaded chicken tenderloins in an air fryer basket. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
